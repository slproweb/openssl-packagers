OpenSSL Installers/Packagers
============================

This repository is an intermediate location as part of the ongoing discussion about building official binary installer packages for Windows for the OpenSSL project and then potentially for other operating systems.

This repository is not, at this time, an officially sanctioned OpenSSL project repository but contains code and resources that may merge into an official repository.  Official repositories are located here:

https://github.com/openssl/

Public discussion is currently being conducted at:
